# AnimalCrossingVillagerFinder

Welcome to Animal Crossing Villager Finder! Did you know there are over 300 villagers in Animal Crossing New Horizons? With so many villagers it can be hard to find the specific one you're looking for! This CLI gem offers many different ways to sort through an learn more about the individual villagers, by scraping information from: https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_list_(New_Horizons)

As well as a 'Guess the Villager' mini game!

**NOTE: The minigame implements code from this gem: https://rubygems.org/gems/asciiart/versions/0.0.9
but there is a deprecated requirement, preventing me from using that gem. The code that is found in lib/AnimalCrossingVillagerFinder/ascii.rb is from that gem!!!**
